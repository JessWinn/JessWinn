- 👋 Hi there, I’m @JessWinn. I am a postgraduate student living and working in beautiful Stellenbosch.
- 👀 I’m interested in conservation genomics. This is something I was only introduced to recently but it is a growing passion of mine.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my Masters in Genetics with a focus on phylogenomics and population genetics in houndsharks. The goal in our lab is to use genetic tools to better manage and protect threatened species.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing bioinformatic pipelines to efficiently analyse genomic data. I am still learning but I think NGS data holds so almost endless potential if handled correctly.
